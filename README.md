NOTE: This is my first project, my code is pretty bad in some areas and there are some small text errors that doesn't impact the gameplay, but I haven't found any game breaking errors

Current known Errors:
* In the boss battle, sometimes randomly, it makes the player have to dodge multiple times for it to work, and the boss monster can't attack back during this
      Which is why I don't consider this bug game-breaking. I am still working on fixing it.
